## Installation
With python3 : `pip install async-channel`

## Usage
Example
```python
import async_channel.consumer as consumer
import async_channel.producer as producer
import async_channel.channels as channels
import async_channel.util as util

class AwesomeProducer(producer.Producer):
    pass

class AwesomeConsumer(consumer.Consumer):
    pass

class AwesomeChannel(channels.Channel):
    PRODUCER_CLASS = AwesomeProducer
    CONSUMER_CLASS = AwesomeConsumer

async def callback(data):
    print("Consumer called !")
    print("Received : " + data)

# Creates the channel
await util.create_channel_instance(AwesomeChannel, channels.Channels)

# Add a new consumer to the channel
await channels.Channels.get_chan("Awesome").new_consumer(callback)

# Creates a producer that send data to the consumer through the channel
producer = AwesomeProducer(channels.Channels.get_chan("Awesome"))
await producer.run()
await producer.send("test")

# Stops the channel with all its producers and consumers
# await channels.Channels.get_chan("Awesome").stop()
```
